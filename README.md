## A Next 13 blog with MongoDB CRUD operations, styled with Tailwind.

The objective of this project is to explore a variety of relevant technologies while creating a complete and functional project. The resources used were:

### Next.js 13.4
With the latest version of Next.js, it was possible to leverage the App Router technology to create server-side and client-side components. This approach enabled direct API calls from the server-side component, eliminating the need for getStaticProps and getServiceSideProps functions. As a result, significant performance improvements were achieved and the application was optimized for search engines (SEO).

### TailwindCSS
TailwindCSS was implemented to develop a simple and efficient interface. This library offers a diverse range of pre-defined styles that can be seamlessly applied to components, saving valuable development time.

### Mongoose
Mongoose was integrated into the project to create an API that communicates with a MongoDB database, enabling CRUD operations. This library simplifies the interaction with the database by providing a convenient abstraction layer.

### Next Auth
Next Auth was employed to facilitate user registration through email and password, as well as authentication using Google Authenticator. This library streamlines the authentication process by providing pre-built features, eliminating the need to develop everything from scratch.

These technologies were carefully selected to optimize development and deliver an enhanced user experience. By leveraging Next.js, TailwindCSS, Mongoose, and Next Auth, it was possible to improve technical proficiency in highly sought-after tools within the professional market.
